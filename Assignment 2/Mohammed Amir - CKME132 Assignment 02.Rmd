This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

Use RStudio for this assignment. 
Edit the file `assignment-2.Rmd` and insert your R code where wherever you see the string "INSERT YOUR ANSWER HERE"

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. 

When your are done with your answers and before submitting, save the file with the following naming convention :your **Lastname_firstname**

Submit **both** the rmd and the pdf output(or word or html) files, failing to submit **both** will be subject to mark deduction.

This assignment makes use of data that is provided by the
`ISwR` package.

```{r}
library(ISwR)
```

## Sample Question and Solution

Use `seq()` to create the vector $(1,2,3,\ldots,10)$.

```{r}
seq(1,10)
```

## Question 1 -  35%

In this question you will explore the relation between blood pressure and obesity.
The data frame `bp.obese` measures blood pressure, obsesity, and sex on a random sample of
adults.

a) Print the head of `bp.obese` to familiarize yourself with the data.

```{r}
head(bp.obese)
```

b) Print a summary of `bp.obese`.

```{r}
summary(data.frame(bp.obese$sex, bp.obese$obese, bp.obese$bp))

```

Note that `sex` is a numeric vector but it should be a factor.

c) Convert  `sex` from numeric to a factor type with two levels in bp.obese.
```{r}
as.factor(bp.obese$sex)

```
d) Use `str` to check the structure after the conversion
```{r}
str(as.factor(bp.obese$sex))
```
e) Use `sapply`, `any`, and `is.na` to check if there are any `NA` values in each column of `bp.obese`.

```{r}
any((sapply(bp.obese$sex,is.na)),(sapply(bp.obese$obese,is.na)),(sapply(bp.obese$bp,is.na)))

```

f) Assign the obesity and blood pressure measurements to numeric vectors `obesity` and `bp`.
Generate a scatter plot of `bp` on the vertical axis versus `obesity` on the horizontal axis.

```{r}
obesity <- c(bp.obese$obese)
bp <- c(bp.obese$bp)
plot(obesity, bp,ylab="BP", xlab="OBESITY", main = "OBESITY VS BP GRAPH")        
```

Note that blood pressure appears to be positively correlated with obesity.

g) Compute the Pearson correlation $r$ and covariance of `obesity` and `bp`.

```{r}
#Person's Correlation
cor(obesity,bp)

#Covariance
cov(obesity,bp)
```
h) determine the type and strength of the relationship. (note when you inserst your answer make sure to use a # at the begining)
```{r}
# The Pearson correlation value is 0.326 indicating a positive weak correlation

```

## Question 2 - 35%

Consider the probability distribution associated with rolling 3 fair dice.
We can label the faces of a single die using the numbers from 1 to 6.
We can therefore label the simple events in this distribution by triples of numbers from 1 to 6.
Let `d1`, `d2`, and `d3` represent the labels on each of the dice.

a) Set `d1` to the sequence (1,2,...,6) repeated 36 times.

```{r}
d1 <- rep(1:6,36)
d1
```

b) Set `d2` to the sequence consisting of 6 repetitions of the sequence in which each of the numbers (1,2,...,6) is repeated 6 times.

```{r}
d2 <- rep(1:6, each = 6, 6)
d2
```

c) Set `d3` to the sequence in which each of the numbers (1,2,...,6) is repeated 36 times.

```{r}
d3 <- rep(1:6, c(36,36,36,36,36,36))
d3
```
d) Create a new data frame `three.dice` from `d1`, `d2`, and `d3` and print it.
Visually confirm that there are $6 \times 6 \times 6 = 216$ rows and each row contains a unique combination of dice labels.

```{r}
three.dice <- data.frame(d1,d2,d3)
print(three.dice)  
```
e) Since the dice are fair and independent, each simple event has the same probability, namely $\frac{1}{216}$. Add the column `P` to the data frame with this value.
```{r}
p <- rep("1/216",216)
three.dice <- cbind (three.dice, p)
print(three.dice)
```
f) Add a new column `sum` equal to the sum of the dice labels.
Add another new column `mean` equal to the average of the dice labels.

```{r}

df1 <- data.frame(d1,d2,d3)
df2 <- data.frame( RowSum = rowSums(df1), RowMeans = rowMeans(df1))
df3 <- cbind(three.dice,df2)
three.dice <- df3
three.dice
```
g) Plot a probability histogram of `three.dice$sum`.

```{r}
#Insert your answer here
hist(three.dice$RowSum)
```
h) Compute the probability that the sum of the dice is greater then 12 and less than 18.

**HINT**: Use `subset()` to select the events and sum `P`.

```{r}
#Insert your answer here
nrow(subset(data.frame(three.dice),three.dice$RowSum > 12 & three.dice$RowSum < 18))*(1/216)
```
i) Compute the probability that the sum is even.

```{r}
#Insert your answer here
nrow(subset(data.frame(three.dice),three.dice$RowSum %%2 == 0))*(1/216)
```
j) Compute the probability that the mean is exactly 4.

```{r}
#Insert your answer here
nrow(subset(data.frame(three.dice),three.dice$RowMeans == 4))*(1/216)

```

\newpage
## Question 3 - 30%
a)You have two groups of distinctly different items, 10 in the first group and 8 in the second. If you select one item from each group, how many different pairs can you form?
```{r}
#use the mn rule
m <- 10
n <- 8
y <- (m*n)
y
```
b)Evaluate the following permutation $P_{3}^5$

```{r}
x <- factorial(0:5)/factorial(0:2)
x
```
c)In how many ways can you select five people from a group of eight if the order of selection is important?
```{r}
#Since order is important, you use permutations
# n!/(n-k)!
factorial(0:8)/factorial(0:3)
```
d)In how many ways can you select two people from a group of 20 if the order of selection is not important?
```{r}
#Since order is unimportant, you use combinations
# n!/k!(n-k)!
factorial(20)/(factorial(2) * factorial(18))
```
